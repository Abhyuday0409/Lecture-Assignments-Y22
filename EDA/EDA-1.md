# EDA-1 Assignment
Made by: Heril Changwal and Aashwin Sharma
## Problem 1:
## Task 1
Get the Data from [this link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Automobile) and perform Exploratory Dataset Analysis on the same. You must tackle all the missing values present and also visualise the data as much as you can by plotting various plots,heatmaps,correlation matrix etc. 
You should present atleat five informational insights which you were able to grab from the data.
Your notebook should be presented in a well-defined manner.
 

## Task 2
"Algorithms like K-nearest and Naive Bayes support data with missing values."<br>
Justify the above statement in your own words, you may skip Naive Bayes but KNN is a must.

## Task 3
Go through this cool [Pokemon Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mariotormo/complete-pokemon-dataset-updated-090420).
Perform a detailed EDA on this Data and answer the following questions -
1. How many Pokemon are in each Generation?
2. Who is the most powerful pokemon ?
3. In terms of dual types (Pokemon with 2 different types), What is the most common combination?
4. Present the names of the Pokemons having Maximum and Minimum Feature Values corresponding to `attack` ,  `defense` ,  `sp_attack` , `sp_defense` , `hp` , `speed` and `catch_rate`.


## Task 4
Go through this short [Hands-on Tutorial](https://courses.analyticsvidhya.com/courses/take/loan-prediction-practice-problem-using-python/texts/6119418-understanding-the-data).Try to understand how the Data is cleaned and prepared before training a model. <br>
(Not Compulsory) - If you are able to code along and reach the end of the tutorial,you can make a submission regarding this on [this link](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/#About). Share the Submission results if you made a Successful Submission !



PS- Don't forget to refer the related Documentations of [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/index.html),[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html),[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html#missing-data) etc. while working and experimenting with the Data.

## How to Submit?
Submit a well-formatted Jupyter Notebook. Use Markdown cells to separate each question and for any explanation that you wish to provide.

Create your notebook inside `EDA-1-Submissions/` and name it as `<your>-<name>.ipynb`
